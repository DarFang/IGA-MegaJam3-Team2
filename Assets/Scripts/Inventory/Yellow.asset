  description: "When Wen Ruyi holds this orb aloft, the golden flame at its heart
    illuminates the ancient spines of books and the path ahead through the library\u2019s
    labyrinthine halls. \n\r\nPeering into the flames, one can see Wen Ruyi seated
    on a stool in an empty gallery. Her mother stands beside her, surveying the walls.
    It is Wen Ruyi\u2019s first exhibition. Her mother squeezes her shoulder and
    murmurs in wonder. Wen Ruyi glances over at her mother, and it strikes her for
    the first time in a long time that her mother, and many other loved ones, are
    proud of her.\r\n\nWen Ruyi can feel the faint presences of those who accepted
    her as a person, a friend, an artist. She carries this feeling with her, and
    the library feels less alien, as though pieces of herself are hidden all over
    this great repository."
