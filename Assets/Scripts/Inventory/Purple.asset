  description: "Her heart beats in rhythm to the quiet strength emanating from the
    orb. \n\r\nNo longer will the shadows taunt her and make her shiver with fear.
    No more will the creatures hiding underneath her bed torment her.\n\r\nShe\u2019ll
    face these Fragments with the indomitable courage she gained from Metus. The
    Library of Limbo holds many secrets, but Wen Ruyi is determined to solve them.
    What fate awaits her at the end of this journey? Only time will tell."
