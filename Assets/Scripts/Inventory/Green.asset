  description: "A faint warmth lingers, like the quiet calm after a long, gnawing
    ache. The emptiness softens, and for a moment, it feels complete.\r\n\nThe orb
    evokes a time when Wen Ruyi, absentmindedly sketched on a napkin and gave it
    to a curious child nearby. The child\u2019s delight made her spirit feel full.
    \r\n\nThat sketch was far from monumental, yet it felt meaningful. The child\u2019s
    delight healed the lingering ache within her."
