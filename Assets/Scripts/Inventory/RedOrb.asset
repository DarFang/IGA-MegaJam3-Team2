  description: "Her heart finds peace as she holds the orb gently in her hands. The
    turmoil locked deep inside is finally freed.\r\n\nWen Ruyi remembers staring
    at her paintings feeling as if she would never amount to anything. She wanted
    to rip them to shreds until there was nothing left to remind her of her failures.
    The darkness of her room was not enough to cover the sickening reflection she
    saw in the mirror.\r\n\nBut, with Zenghen Ai\u2019s unwavering love to guide
    her, Wen Ruyi blooms like a lotus from muddy waters. Her hatred for herself washes
    away and she is reborn anew. Her journey is complete and she hopes the Vermilion
    Bird will usher her safe passage to the celestial realm."
