  description: "The orb\u2019s glow gives Wen Ruyi confidence in herself and in her
    ability to find a way out of this strange limbo. \n\r\nThe orb evokes a memory
    of an art competition many years ago. It was the first time she had entered into
    an advanced category. She won second, then first the very next year! \r\n\nShe
    did belong. She proved that to herself and everyone else at that competition.
    She belonged in the art world and nobody could take her confidence away. "
